# Login Page UI Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. **Main Application Container Conflict**
**Problem**: The login page was being wrapped inside the main application container with header navigation, causing layout conflicts and showing unnecessary UI elements on the auth page.

**Solution**: 
- Removed the application shell from `index.html`
- Made `ui-view` the root element to allow each component to define its own layout
- Added application shell (header + main content) to individual authenticated pages

### 2. **Bootstrap vs Momentum Theme CSS Conflicts**
**Problem**: Bootstrap classes were conflicting with custom Momentum theme classes, causing styling issues.

**Solution**:
- Added specific CSS overrides for form controls in auth pages
- Fixed `.form-control.momentum-input` conflicts
- Ensured proper button styling for `.btn.momentum-btn-primary`
- Added proper responsive fixes for Bootstrap grid system

### 3. **Layout and Spacing Issues**
**Problem**: Login page layout was broken due to improper container structure and conflicting margins/paddings.

**Solution**:
- Added proper Bootstrap grid structure with `container-fluid`
- Fixed responsive spacing for different screen sizes
- Ensured proper full-height layout (`100vh`) for auth container
- Added proper padding and margin overrides

### 4. **Component Structure Updates**
**Problem**: After removing the application shell from index.html, authenticated pages lost their navigation.

**Solution**:
- Updated `dashboard.component.html` to include header navigation
- Updated `knowledge-share.component.html` to include header navigation  
- Updated `new-signoff-form.component.html` to include header navigation
- Each authenticated page now has its own complete layout structure

## Files Modified

### 1. **index.html**
- Simplified to just contain `<div ui-view></div>`
- Removed application shell to prevent conflicts with login page

### 2. **signup-login.component.html**

### 3. **momentum-theme.css**
